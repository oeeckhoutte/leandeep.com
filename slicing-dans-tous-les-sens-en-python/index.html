This lets you take every n-th item when slicing # a sequence. For example, the stride makes it easy to group by even and odd # indexes in a list. a = [&#39;red&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;purple&#39;] odds = a[::2] evens = a[1::2] print(odds) print(evens) # [&#39;red&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;] # [&#39;orange&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;purple&#39;] # The problem is that the stride syntax ofter cause unexpected behavior that # can introduce bugs. For example, a common Python trick for reversing a byte # string is to slice the string with a stride of -1. x = b&#39;mongoose&#39; y = x[::-1] print(y) # b&#39;esoognom&#39; # That works well for byte strings and ASCII characters, but it will break for # Unicode characters encoded as UTF-8 byte strings. w = &#39;谢谢谢谢&#39; # x = w.enocde(&#39;utf-8&#39;) # y = x[::-1] # z = y.decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;) # print(y) # print(z) # AttributeError: &#39;str&#39; object has no attribute &#39;enocde&#39; # Are negative strides besides -1 useful? Consider the following examples. a = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39;h&#39;] print(a[::2]) print(a[::-2]) # [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;g&#39;] # [&#39;h&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;b&#39;] # Here, ::2 means select every second item starting at the beginning. # Trickier, ::-2 means select every second item starting at the end and moving # backwards. # What do you think 2::2 means?

Having three numbers within the brackets is hard enough to read # because of its density. Then it&#39;s not obvious when the start and end indexes # come into effect relative to the stride value, especially when stride is # negative. # To prevent problems, avoid using stride along with start and end indexes. If # you must use a stride, prefer making it a positive value and omit start and # end indexes. If you must use stride with start and end indexes, consider # using one assignment to stride and another to slice. b = a[::2] c = b[1:-1] print(b) print(c) # [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;g&#39;] # [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;] # Slicing and then striding will create an extra shallow copy of the data. # The first operation should try to reduce the size of the resulting slice by # as much as possible. If your program can&#39;t afford the time or memory # required for two steps, consider using the itertools built-in module&#39;s # islice method (see Item 46: Use built-in algorithms and data structures), # which doesn&#39;t permit negative values for start, end or stride. # Things to remember # 1. Avoid being verbose: Don&#39;t supply 0 for the start index or the length of # the sequence for the end index. # 2. Slicing is forgiving of start or end indexes that are out of bounds, # making it easy to express slices on the front or back boundaries of a # sequence (like a[:20] or a[-20:]). # 3. Assigning to a list slice will replace that range in the original # sequence with what&#39;s referenced even if their lengths are different. # 4. Specifying start, end, and stride in a slice can be extremely confusing. # 5. Prefer using positive stride values in slices without start or end # indexes. Avoid negative stride values if possible. # 6. Avoid using start, end and stride together in a single slice. If you need # all three parameters, consider doing two assignments (one to slice, # another to stride) or using islice form itertools built-in module.

# required for two steps, consider using the itertools built-in module&#39;s
# islice method (see Item 46: Use built-in algorithms and data structures),
# which doesn&#39;t permit negative values for start, end or stride.
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code># Things to remember

# 1. Avoid being verbose: Don&#39;t supply 0 for the start index or the length of
#     the sequence for the end index.
# 2. Slicing is forgiving of start or end indexes that are out of bounds,
#     making it easy to express slices on the front or back boundaries of a
#     sequence (like a[:20] or a[-20:]).
# 3. Assigning to a list slice will replace that range in the original
#     sequence with what&#39;s referenced even if their lengths are different.
# 4. Specifying start, end, and stride in a slice can be extremely confusing.
# 5. Prefer using positive stride values in slices without start or end
#     indexes. Avoid negative stride values if possible.
# 6. Avoid using start, end and stride together in a single slice. If you need
#     all three parameters, consider doing two assignments (one to slice,
#     another to stride) or using islice form itertools built-in module.
