      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of 360° videos recorded with a 360 camera, and I wanted to be able to stream them from my laptop. I’ve been wanting to experiment with VR app development for a long time, so I built an app using Rust as the backend server and WebXR for the UI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The learning curve between WebXR and Unity is much lower for a former frontend developer. I developed PWA apps for about 10 years, from 2009 to 2019, so it was pretty easy for me to pick it up. Having recently built the UI of a social network in React, transitioning to WebXR was seamless. Compared to Unity, the difference is night and day. I gave Unity a shot with no prior experience, and honestly, getting started was tough. Moreover I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of C#.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
